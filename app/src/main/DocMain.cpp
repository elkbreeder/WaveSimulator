 * \section i Intro
 * 
 * This project uses the open-source SWE-implementation,
 * to allow the user to set up any desired Tsunami scenario, 
 * placeable objects in an given domain of calmed water.
 * 
 * \section f Functions
 * \subsection sf Creating Waves
 * The user can create waves of variable height by tapping the domain. The height can be adjusted via the Wave-Hight-Slider below the water domain.
 * \subsection sf1 Creating Obstacles
 * The user can create equally high obstacles by selecting the draw mode(brush Symbol in the top right corner).
 * While pressing once in this mode will result in a circular obstacle,
 * moving around allows for the creation of any desired shape.
 * \subsection Removing Obstacles
 * This can be done in the same fashion as the creation, as long as the Erase_Mode is chosen(minus-symbol on top of the domain).
 * Tapping once will activate the Erase_Mode. Tapping again will change the mode back to normal.
 * \subsection Boundaries
 * The domain-boundaries can be chosen to be reflective or open. This is done by tapping the "Reflective Boundaries" switch located below the domain.
 * \subsection Resetting
 * The user can choose to reset only the waves or the whole domain. This is done by tapping the options button in the top right corner of the screen
 * and then choosing the wanted option.
