\hypertarget{index_i}{}\section{Intro}\label{index_i}
This project uses the open-\/source S\+W\+E-\/implementation, to allow the user to set up any desired Tsunami scenario, placeable objects in an given domain of calmed water.\hypertarget{index_f}{}\section{Functions}\label{index_f}
\hypertarget{index_sf}{}\subsection{Creating Waves}\label{index_sf}
The user can create waves of variable height by tapping the domain. The height can be adjusted via the Wave-\/\+Hight-\/\+Slider below the water domain. \hypertarget{index_sf1}{}\subsection{Creating Obstacles}\label{index_sf1}
The user can create equally high obstacles by selecting the draw mode(brush Symbol in the top right corner). While pressing once in this mode will result in a circular obstacle, moving around allows for the creation of any desired shape. \hypertarget{index_Removing}{}\subsection{Obstacles}\label{index_Removing}
This can be done in the same fashion as the creation, as long as the Erase\+\_\+\+Mode is chosen(minus-\/symbol on top of the domain). Tapping once will activate the Erase\+\_\+\+Mode. Tapping again will change the mode back to normal. \hypertarget{index_Boundaries}{}\subsection{Boundaries}\label{index_Boundaries}
The domain-\/boundaries can be chosen to be reflective or open. This is done by tapping the \char`\"{}\+Reflective Boundaries\char`\"{} switch located below the domain. \hypertarget{index_Resetting}{}\subsection{Resetting}\label{index_Resetting}
The user can choose to reset only the waves or the whole domain. This is done by tapping the options button in the top right corner of the screen and then choosing the wanted option.
